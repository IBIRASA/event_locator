## 1. Project Overview

The Event Locator API is a backend service designed to manage user authentication, event creation and retrieval, event ratings, and user favorite events. It provides a RESTful API for client applications (web or mobile) to interact with event data.

## 2. Technical Choices

- **Node.js & Express.js:** Chosen for its scalability, performance, and the availability of a wide range of libraries.
- **PostgreSQL:** Selected for its robust data integrity, advanced querying capabilities, and support for the PostGIS extension for spatial queries.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Used for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Redis:** Employed for real-time event notifications.
- **i18next:** Used for language localization and internationalization.
- **dotenv:** Used to manage environment variables.

## 3. Prerequisites

- **Node.js (>= 14.x):** Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm or yarn:** Usually installed with Node.js.
- **PostgreSQL (with PostGIS):** Install and configure PostgreSQL, enabling the PostGIS extension for location-based queries.
- **Redis:** Install and run a Redis server for real-time notifications.
- **Postman or similar API testing tool:** Recommended for testing API endpoints.
